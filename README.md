#  Digital Marketing Specialist| Graphic Artist| Musician| Surfer


My career began from a childhood passion for repairing and modifying electronic components of old amplifiers and effects pedals in order to play music. My fascination with creating sound from electronics led to a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, and propelled me towards a career in electrical engineering. Throughout my professional journey, I specialized in hardware and power supply design within the Professional and Consumer Audio sectors.

I am currently advancing my development skills via the University of Massachusetts Global Software Engineering Bootcamp, and actively exploring hybrid or remote career opportunities in the West Los Angeles/South Bay areas, as well as remote world-wide.

My acheivements resulted from a sincere, personal passion for engineering that took root in my childhood and has shaped my adulthood. My unwavering determination to solve problems and devise innovative solutions through  self-guided practice and active learning is a benchmark of my lifestyle.

This GitHUb contains some of my current independent projects, freelance work for clients, as well as additional projects related to UMASS Global's Software Engineering Bootcamp
