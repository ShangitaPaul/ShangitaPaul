# Software Engineer| Music Industry Freelancer| Technologist| Musician| Surfer


My engineering career was fueled by a childhood passion for music. Despite my parent's initial concerns about music distracting me from my studies, I secretly aquired broken guitars, amps, and pedals, and went to my hometown's public library to study electronics in order to repair them for playing. The damped harmonics, heavy distortion, and high gain effects of the Grunge era captivated me, and inspired me to redesign electronics to withstand aggressive signals that would typically compromise the equipments functionality and reliability.

After earning a B.S. in Physics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, I went onto pursue a successful career in electrical engineering; specializing in hardware design within the Pro-Audio and Consumer Electronics sectors.

My acheivements resulted from a sincere, personal passion for engineering that took root in my childhood and has shaped my adulthood. My unwavering determination to solve problems and devise innovative solutions through independent guided practice is a benchmark of my lifestyle.

I am currently transitioning into Software Engineering via the University of Massachusetts Global Software Engineering Bootcamp, and actively exploring hybrid or remote career opportunities in the West Los Angeles/South Bay areas, as well as remote world-wide.
